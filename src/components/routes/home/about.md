## About me

I enjoy working on personal projects. My focus tends to be on automation of menial tasks. I recently built an aquarium filter using neural networks to predict water levels and temperatures over time. I also use machine learning to build bots to play MMO games.

In a previous life, I spent all of my time in my recording studio. Though most of my musical projects will forever remain private, my love for professional audio shapes my perspective for future work.
